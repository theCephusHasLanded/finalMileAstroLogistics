#Planet Purchase Plans Backend
##Backend for Planet Purchase Plans

#Description
This repository contains the backend code for Planet Purchase Plans, an e-commerce web application for purchasing planets. The backend is built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) and provides the necessary API endpoints to handle data storage and retrieval.

The backend is deployed on the Render platform, which provides reliable hosting and scaling capabilities. The frontend is deployed separately on Netlify, allowing for a decoupled architecture that ensures scalability and efficient separation of concerns.

This project is licensed under the Pursuit.org license.
